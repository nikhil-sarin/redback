Analysis
============

Sometimes, we wish to do further analysis after we fit.
Or before fitting get a understanding of the priors to set, develop a new model, plot the spectrum etc.
In :code:`redback` we have a :code:`Analysis` class that can be used to do this.

This class provides wrappers around the plot_lightcurve/plot_multiband_lightcurve functions in :code:`redback.plotting`
and provides a :code:`plot_spectrum` function and some additional diagnostic/supplementary plots that are specific to certain models.

For example, if we wanted to plot a some specific parameters on top of the plot_lightcurve plot, we can do the following:

.. code:: python

    from redback import analysis

    analysis.plot_lightcurve(transient, parameters, model, model_kwargs=None)

Here

- transient is the transient object.
- Parameters is a dictionary or pandas dataframe containing the parameters we wish to plot.
- model is the model we wish to plot. This can be a string or a function.
- model_kwargs is a dictionary of keyword arguments to pass to the model function.

Spectral Template Matching
==========================

The :code:`SpectralTemplateMatcher` class provides SNID-like spectral classification:

.. code:: python

    from redback.analysis import SpectralTemplateMatcher

    matcher = SpectralTemplateMatcher()
    result = matcher.match_spectrum(spectrum, redshift_range=(0, 0.3))
    print(f"Type: {result['type']}, z={result['redshift']:.3f}")

For detailed documentation on spectral template matching, see :doc:`spectral_template_matching`.

Please look at the API for the other methods available in the :code:`Analysis` class.

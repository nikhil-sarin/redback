The paper describing :code:`redback` is submitted and available `here <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230812806S/abstract>`_.
If you use :code:`redback` in a scientific publication please cite this paper and mention it as a software used depending on the journal.
Some specific instances/examples of acknowledgements are given below.
The main repository includes a bibtex citation for the :code:`redback` paper.

Using :code:`redback` to fit transients
-------------------------

If you use :code:`redback` to fit an electromagnetic transient,
please cite the `Bilby paper <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2018arXiv181102042A/abstract>`_,
and the :code:`redback` paper.

Alongside this we request that you also cite the paper associated with the sampler you use.
Furthermore, several models implemented in :code:`redback` are introduced in previous scientific publications.
These scientific publications are easily accessible via :code:`model_name.citation` or as a reference in a class.

For example,

.. code:: python

    from redback.transient_models import kilonova_models
    import numpy as np

    citation = kilonova_models.one_component_kilonova_model.citation

Here citation will be a url or a series of urls to the NASA ads page for the paper describing the model.
If you use a specific model or build upon it, we request that you also cite the paper for the model.

In several cases, the citation will be `redback`, in which case,
only a citation to :code:`redback`, :code:`bilby`, and the sampler is necessary.
Although we recommend periodically checking the citation in the latest :code:`redback` release.

For optical transients (if you fit in magnitudes/flux), we request that you also cite `SNCosmo <https://sncosmo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`_ as that is used to convert redback
spectra to magnitudes and integrated bandpass flux.

Using :code:`redback` to simulate transients
-------------------------

If you use the capability of :code:`redback` to simulate a population of transients,
please cite the :code:`redback` paper and the paper for the model you use.


Using :code:`redback` to download transient data
-------------------------

If you use :code:`redback` to simply download and process data for different transients,
please cite the :code:`redback` paper.


General citation text
-------------------------

We recommend something like the following text for citing :code:`redback` in a scientific publication:

For using :code:`redback` to fit transients:

- We fit the transient using the open source software package {\sc Redback}~\cite{sarin_redback},
  with the {model_name}~\citep{model reference} model using the {sampler} sampler~\citep{sampler reference} wrapped with bilby~\citep{Ashton+2019}.

For using :code:`redback` to simulate transients:

- We simulate transients using the open source software package {\sc Redback}~\cite{sarin_redback}, with the {model_name}~\citep{model reference} model.

For using :code:`redback` to download transient data:

- We download and process this data using the API provided for {name of data source}~\citep{citation to the source} by the open source software package {\sc Redback}~\cite{sarin_redback}.

For using :code:`redback` to estimate blackbody temperatures/radius and luminosities:

- We estimate the blackbody temperature/radius (and/or) luminosities using {\sc Redback}~\cite{sarin_redback}.

For using :code:`redback` to do any GP interpolation:

- We interpolate using a Gaussian Process with the kernel {kernel} available in {\sc george}~\citep{george paper} through the {\sc Redback} package~\cite{sarin_redback}.

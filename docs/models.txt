============

In :code:`redback` we have already implemented a lot of different models, which can be combined or modified to create another model easily.
These models range from phenomenological, to analytical, semi-analytical to numerical surrogates built with machine learning techniques.
Implementing a new model is probably the easiest way to contribute to redback!

Specifically, some models already included are as follows.

Using :code:`redback` models as functions
-------------------------

All models in :code:`redback` are implemented as functions with minimal dependencies.
This means that users can simply use these functions by themselves as you would any other python function.
All users need to do is pass into the function a time array and any other parameter required by the function.
In this way, users can use :code:`redback` to just explore the impact of different parameters on the light curve and better understand the physics.

For example:

.. code:: python

    from redback.constants import day_to_s
    from redback.model_library import all_models_dict
    import numpy as np

    model = 'arnett_bolometric'

    function = all_models_dict[model]
    time = np.logspace(2, 8, 100)/day_to_s
    bolometric_luminosity = function(time, f_nickel=0.6,
                        mej=30, vej=1000, kappa=2, kappa_gamma=1e2)

Here we use `all_models_dict` to provide a simple way to access the relevant function. A user could of course just import the function themselves.

Users can also use the prior objects to get a simulation of the light curves predicted by the function for randomly drawn samples from the prior.

.. code:: python

    from redback.constants import day_to_s
    from redback.model_library import all_models_dict
    from redback.priors import get_priors
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd

    model = 'arnett_bolometric'
    priors = get_priors(model=model, data_mode='luminosity')
    samples = pd.DataFrame(priors.sample(100))
    function = all_models_dict[model]
    time = np.logspace(2, 8, 100)/day_to_s

    bolometric_luminosity = function(time, **samples.iloc[0])

Remember that the priors are simply a dictionary so users could also just pass a dictionary/dataframe they created themselves as well.

Users could also sample a lot of different draws from the prior at once (in the above we randomly drew 100 samples) and then loop through them to simulate a population.
Remember that we can also place arbitrary constraints on the priors to make a really specific population/simulation.
For example, we could make a constraint that all priors in the population were brighter than 24th mag at peak or something else.
Almost any time of constraint is possible, as long as it can be written mathematically. Please look at prior documentation for more details on constraints.
We could also use the :code:`redback` `simulation` module to simulate realistic lightcurves of these drawn parameters in a real survey.
Helping capture selection effects in even more detail.

Modifying :code:`redback` models
-------------------------

A lot of the physics in different :code:`redback` models is set by default.
However, several pieces of physics in various models can be changed by either passing your own function/class (see `dependency injections <https://redback.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dependency_injections.html>`_),
by switching the default argument with something else already implemented in redback, or changing a keyword argument.

The specific physics that can be changed:

- Jet spreading on/off
- Whether to infer lorentz factor in afterglow models
- Whether to turn on/off pair cascades
- Whether to turn on/off neutron precursor emission
- Different ejecta relations: See relations already implemented `here <https://github.com/nikhil-sarin/redback/blob/master/redback/ejecta_relations.py>`_.
- Different equations of states: See eos already implemented `here <https://github.com/nikhil-sarin/redback/blob/master/redback/eos.py>`_.
- Different interaction process: See processes already implemented `here <https://github.com/nikhil-sarin/redback/blob/master/redback/interaction_processes.py>`_.
- Different photosphere: See photospheres already implemented `here <https://github.com/nikhil-sarin/redback/blob/master/redback/photosphere.py>`_.
- Different SED: See SED's already implemented `here <https://github.com/nikhil-sarin/redback/blob/master/redback/sed.py>`_.
- Gamma-ray leakage
- Engines with different energy injection rates
- Several more things. Please look at the model documentation for more details.

We encourage users to add more of these physics switches, which is another easy way to contribute to :code:`redback`.

Extra kwargs and output formats in :code:`redback` models
-------------------------
All :code:`redback` models have a set of extra keyword arguments that can be passed to the function.
For a specific model, users can see the extra keyword arguments by looking at the docstring of the function. These extra variables are passed in as a dictionary via

.. code:: python

    extra_kwargs = {'key1': value1, 'key2': value2}
    function(time, **extra_kwargs)

And can allow for more flexibility in the models while keeping the interface of the function simple for the end user.

For several models we also allow users to output the light curve in different formats.
For example, users can output the light curve in `flux_density` or `magnitude` by passing in those via the keyword argument `output_format`.
Or `spectra` itself which will output a multidimensional array of the spectra at each time.
Or `sncosmo_source` which will output the sncosmo source object for the model and the users can then use this to make their own plots or look at model with an SNCosmo interface.

We note that for afterglow models we generally assume the magnitude conversion is a simple conversion from flux density to magnitude, ignoring the affect of the full spectrum.
This can be done in the proper way for the `afterglow_sed` model variants.
While for other transient models, the magnitude/flux values are calculated using the full bandpass/spectrum.
The flux_density output for all models is the flux density at the effective frequency of the filter.

Redback assumes flux_density is always in mJy, luminosity is always in erg/s with some models returning the output in 1e50 erg/s (for numerical stability), and magnitude is always in AB mag.
Flux is always in erg/s/cm^2.

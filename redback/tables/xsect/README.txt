Cross-section tables, this is a copy from astromodels package, and indirectly XSPEC.
They are used to compute the cross-sections for photoelectric absorption.
The files are in FITS format, and can be read using astropy.io.fits or other FITS readers.
They will be automatically read by the redback package when needed.
